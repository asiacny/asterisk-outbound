When the res_outbound making a call, the call kept all the resource info itself. So, if the other resources chagned later, it doesn't affect to the existing call.

It makes call-capsulization.


Dynamic resource management
---------------------------
The res_outbound supports the dynamic resource management.


Campaign scheduling
-------------------
The res_outbound supports the campaign scheduling.

The user can set the auto-start, auto-end.


Set variables
-------------
The res_outbound supports variables setting.

The user can set the variables for each resources.

It can deliver to the dialplan or SIP headers.


Monitoring
----------


AMI action
----------


AMI event
---------


Asterisk cli
------------


Dialplan application
--------------------


Detail dial result
------------------
The res_outbound supports the detail dial result.

In the result, the user can check the all the call info(original info, dialing info, result info).


Resources
=========

Campaign
--------
* Set destination, plan, dial list(dlma).

Destination
-----------
* Call's transfer destination after customer has answered.

Plan
----
Dialling stragegy.
* UUI delivery.
* Dial mode
* Dialing control.

Dial list
---------
Customer info list.
* Dial number.
* UUI info.

Campaign
========
Determine why make a call(Why).

To dial to the customer, the user need to create the campaign first and need to assign the correct resources(destination, plan, dial list master).

Then the resources determine where/what/who/how/when make a call to the customer.

Status
------
The campaign has a status. See detail :ref:`campaign_status`.

Scheduling
----------
The user can sets scheduling for campaign. See detail :ref:`scheduling`.


Plan
====
Determine how/when to make a call(How/When).

Dial mode
---------
The user can sets the dial mode. See detail :ref:`dial_mode`.

Predictive
++++++++++
* Predict the number of customers to dial based on the deliver application/agent's answer rate.
* Predict how many call will be answered or not answered.
* Calculate possilbilties automatically.

Preview
+++++++
* The destination makes decision to make a call.
* Developing.

SMS
+++
* Send an SMS messages

Service level
-------------
Service level controling the amount of dailing.


.. _service_level:

::

   (Max available outbound call count) - (Current outbound call count) + (Service level) = (Available call count)

   If the (Available call count) is bigger than 0, make a call.

Result
======
Result data devided by 5 sections.

Identity info, Dial info, Result info, Timestamp info, Related resources info.
